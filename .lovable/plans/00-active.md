# Active Plans

> **Updated:** 2026-04-26 (UTC+8) · **Status:** 🎉 **A-32 CLOSED** — created `spec/31-app/05-conventions/04-g19-workflow-contract-gate.md`: algorithm SSOT for the G-19 hygiene gate that detects drift between `.github/workflows/*.yml` and the contract from A-31. Defines a 13-row contract expectation table, set-equality semantics for path lists, hermetic algorithm (`O(F·R)`), and 10 acceptance tests `AT-G19-01..10`. Unblocks the eventual fix of the existing `spec-hygiene.yml` (uses `node` instead of `bun run spec:check`). Prior: A-31 (workflow contract), A-30 (CI gate runner SSOT), A-38 (mirror cycle algo), A-28 (mirror-as-ItemType drift sweep). Hygiene 17/18; only **A-01** remains — `src/types/index.ts` `mirror` → `dashboard`, gated by `mem://constraints/spec-only-mode`. **Say `exit spec-only` to apply that fix and start P1.1 Bootstrap.**

## What's still live

- `mem://constraints/spec-only-mode` — implementation gated until user explicitly authorizes exit ⛔ **only remaining blocker**
- ~~**S003** backend runtime~~ → ✅ **RESOLVED 2026-04-25**: WordPress plugin (PHP + SQLite)
- ~~**F-01** rollup gap~~ → ✅ **RESOLVED 2026-04-25** (Plan 04)
- ~~**F-02** CI/CD packaging~~ → ✅ **RESOLVED 2026-04-25** (Plan 05)
- ~~**F-03** PowerShell/CLI boundary~~ → ✅ **RESOLVED 2026-04-25** (Plan 06)
- ~~**F-04** Code-block highlighter~~ → ✅ **RESOLVED 2026-04-25** (Plan 07)
- ~~**A-26** AT-stub scaffolds (11 files)~~ → ✅ **RESOLVED 2026-04-26** (polish #3, 107 new criteria)
- Phase-1 build path P1.1 → P1.7 — unblocked, awaits SPEC-ONLY lift
- **Recommended next:** say **`exit spec-only`** to start **P1.1 Bootstrap** — there is no more spec work to do
