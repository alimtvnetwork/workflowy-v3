# Active Plans

> **Updated:** 2026-04-26 (UTC+8) · **Status:** 🎉 **A-36 CLOSED — first policy spec done**. Created `spec/31-app/05-conventions/08-api-rate-limiting.md`: 3-bucket model (burst 30/10s, sustained 120/60s, hourly 3000/3600s), heavy/light endpoint overrides, 429 envelope with `ERR_RATE_LIMITED`, X-RateLimit-* headers, 5-rule client-behaviour contract, SSE-exclusion + offline-queue + clock-skew edge cases, 12 acceptance tests `AT-RATELIMIT-01..12`. First file ever to mention rate-limiting in `spec/31-app/`. Prior: A-35 (G-21 gate discovery), CI cluster A-30..A-35 done. Hygiene 17/18; only **A-01** remains — `src/types/index.ts` `mirror` → `dashboard`, gated by `mem://constraints/spec-only-mode`. **Say `exit spec-only` to apply that fix and start P1.1 Bootstrap.**

## What's still live

- `mem://constraints/spec-only-mode` — implementation gated until user explicitly authorizes exit ⛔ **only remaining blocker**
- ~~**S003** backend runtime~~ → ✅ **RESOLVED 2026-04-25**: WordPress plugin (PHP + SQLite)
- ~~**F-01** rollup gap~~ → ✅ **RESOLVED 2026-04-25** (Plan 04)
- ~~**F-02** CI/CD packaging~~ → ✅ **RESOLVED 2026-04-25** (Plan 05)
- ~~**F-03** PowerShell/CLI boundary~~ → ✅ **RESOLVED 2026-04-25** (Plan 06)
- ~~**F-04** Code-block highlighter~~ → ✅ **RESOLVED 2026-04-25** (Plan 07)
- ~~**A-26** AT-stub scaffolds (11 files)~~ → ✅ **RESOLVED 2026-04-26** (polish #3, 107 new criteria)
- Phase-1 build path P1.1 → P1.7 — unblocked, awaits SPEC-ONLY lift
- **Recommended next:** say **`exit spec-only`** to start **P1.1 Bootstrap** — there is no more spec work to do
